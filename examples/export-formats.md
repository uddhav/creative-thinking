## Export Command Usage

To export a session, use the `sessionOperation: 'export'` with the following options:

```json
{
  "technique": "six_hats",
  "problem": "dummy",
  "currentStep": 1,
  "totalSteps": 1,
  "output": "",
  "nextStepNeeded": false,
  "sessionOperation": "export",
  "exportOptions": {
    "sessionId": "session_123abc",
    "format": "markdown"  // or "json" or "csv"
  }
}
```

## Markdown Export

Markdown export creates a human-readable document perfect for reports, documentation, or sharing insights with others.

### Example Output

```markdown
# How to improve team collaboration

**Date**: 2024-01-15 10:00  
**Technique**: Six Thinking Hats  
**Session ID**: session_123abc  
**Status**: Completed (6/6 steps)

## Session Overview
- **Duration**: 45 minutes
- **Steps Completed**: 6/6
- **Branches**: 2
- **Insights Generated**: 5

## Performance Metrics
- **Creativity Score**: 75
- **Risks Identified**: 8
- **Antifragile Features**: 3

## Thinking Process

### üîµ Step 1
*January 15, 2024 at 10:00 AM*

**BLUE HAT - Process Control**

We need to analyze our collaboration challenges systematically. The goal is to identify concrete improvements that can be implemented within Q1.

### ‚ö™ Step 2
*January 15, 2024 at 10:05 AM*

**WHITE HAT - Facts & Information**

Current facts: 8 team members across 3 time zones, average response time 48 hours, 2 weekly meetings with 60% attendance.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks Identified
- Communication delays affecting project timelines
- Meeting fatigue leading to low engagement

#### ‚úÖ Mitigations
- Implement async communication protocols
- Record all meetings for later viewing

## Key Insights
1. Asynchronous communication is critical for distributed teams
2. Time zone awareness must be built into our workflows
3. Meeting fatigue can be reduced with better agenda management
4. Documentation is key to knowledge sharing
5. Regular social interactions improve team cohesion

## JSON Export

JSON export provides complete session data in a structured format, ideal for programmatic processing and analysis.

### Example Output

```json
{
  "exportMetadata": {
    "exportedAt": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z",
    "exportVersion": "1.0",
    "tool": "Creative Thinking MCP Tool"
  },
  "sessionId": "session_123abc",
  "problem": "How to improve team collaboration",
  "technique": "six_hats",
  "status": "Completed (6/6 steps)",
  "progress": {
    "currentStep": 6,
    "totalSteps": 6,
    "percentComplete": 100
  },
  "metadata": {
    "name": "Team Collaboration Analysis",
    "tags": ["collaboration", "remote-work", "process-improvement"],
    "startTime": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "endTime": "2024-01-15T10:45:00Z",
    "duration": "45 minutes"
  },
  "history": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
      "output": "We need to analyze our collaboration challenges...",
      "technique": "six_hats",
      "hatColor": "blue",
      "risks": ["Scope creep", "Analysis paralysis"],
      "mitigations": ["Time-boxed analysis", "Clear objectives"]
    }
  ],
  "insights": {
    "count": 5,
    "items": [
      "Asynchronous communication is critical",
      "Time zone awareness needed",
      "Documentation is key"
    ]
  },
  "metrics": {
    "creativityScore": 75,
    "risksCaught": 8,
    "antifragileFeatures": 3,
    "summary": {
      "overallCreativity": "Creative",
      "riskAwareness": "Good Risk Awareness",
      "robustness": "Somewhat Robust"
    }
  },
  "statistics": {
    "totalOutputLength": 3456,
    "averageOutputLength": 576,
    "uniqueConceptsCount": 24,

session_123,Team collaboration,Six Thinking Hats,45,6/6,75,8,5
session_456,Product innovation,SCAMPER,60,7/7,88,12,8
