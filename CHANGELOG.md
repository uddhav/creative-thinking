### Removed

- **Parallel Execution Architecture** - Simplified to sequential-only execution

  - Removed parallel execution examples and test scripts
  - Cleaned up all parallel-related documentation
  - Simplified ExecutionModeController to always return sequential mode

### Fixed

- **Execution Model** - Now exclusively sequential for depth and coherence
  - Each technique step builds progressively on previous insights
