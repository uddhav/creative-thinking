# Creative Thinking MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides structured creative thinking techniques for
problem-solving and ideation. This server implements a unified framework combining generative
creativity with systematic risk assessment.

> **Note**: This repository is a public fork of work originally developed with Munshy, Personal
> Secretary.

## Architecture Principles

This project follows a three-layer tool architecture as its core design principle:

1. **Discovery** - Intelligent technique selection based on problem analysis
2. **Planning** - Structured workflow creation combining multiple techniques
3. **Execution** - Guided step-by-step implementation with state management

### Fundamental Design Decision: Three Tools Only

**This MCP server exposes EXACTLY three tools - no more, no less:**

- `discover_techniques` - Analyzes problems and recommends techniques
- `plan_thinking_session` - Creates structured workflows
- `execute_thinking_step` - Executes individual steps

**All functionality must be integrated into these three tools.** This includes:

- Escape velocity analysis (integrated into discovery/planning)
- Option generation (automatic in discovery when flexibility is low)
- Session management (internal state management)
- Future features (must fit within the three-tool workflow)

This constraint ensures a clean, focused API that mirrors the natural creative thinking workflow and
prevents tool proliferation.

## Overview

The three-layer architecture guides you through comprehensive problem-solving:

1. **Discovery Layer** (`discover_techniques`) - Analyzes problems and recommends suitable thinking
   techniques based on characteristics, context, and desired outcomes.

2. **Planning Layer** (`plan_thinking_session`) - Creates structured workflows that combine
   techniques, providing step-by-step guidance adapted to your timeframe.

3. **Execution Layer** (`execute_thinking_step`) - Guides you through each thinking step while
   maintaining session state and integrating risk assessment.

This layered approach ensures efficient problem-solving by matching techniques to problems, creating
comprehensive workflows, and maintaining focus throughout the creative process.

## Installation

### Using npx

```bash
# Run directly from GitHub
npx -y github:uddhav/creative-thinking

# Or if published to npm
npx -y creative-thinking
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/uddhav/creative-thinking.git
cd creative-thinking

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run locally
node dist/index.js
```

## Parallel Execution

The Creative Thinking server supports parallel execution of techniques, allowing multiple thinking
methods to be applied simultaneously for improved performance and diverse perspectives.

### How It Works

When you create a plan with `executionMode: 'parallel'`, the server:

1. Analyzes technique dependencies
2. Groups techniques that can run concurrently
3. Provides guidance for parallel execution
4. Tracks progress across all parallel techniques

### Benefits

- **Performance**: Reduce total thinking time by up to 70% for compatible techniques
- **Diversity**: Apply multiple perspectives simultaneously
- **Flexibility**: Mix parallel and sequential techniques based on dependencies
- **Coordination**: Automatic sync points ensure coherent results

### Example

```javascript
// Step 1: Discover techniques
const discovery = await discoverTechniques({
  problem: 'How to improve team collaboration',
});

// Step 2: Plan with parallel execution
const plan = await planThinkingSession({
  problem: 'How to improve team collaboration',
  techniques: ['six_hats', 'scamper', 'random_entry'],
  executionMode: 'parallel', // Enable parallel execution
});

// Step 3: Execute techniques in parallel
// The plan will indicate which techniques can run simultaneously
// Example response shows parallel groups:
// Group 1: six_hats, scamper, random_entry (can run in parallel)
// Group 2: convergence (runs after all parallel techniques complete)
```

### Technique Compatibility

When barriers are detected, the system recommends specific escape protocols ranging from simple
pattern interruption to strategic pivots, each calibrated to your current flexibility level.

### 🌱 Option Generation Engine

When flexibility drops below 0.4, the system automatically activates the Option Generation Engine to
create new possibilities through eight core strategies plus four advanced techniques:

- **Decomposition** - Break monolithic commitments into flexible modules
- **Temporal** - Adjust time parameters (delay commitments, accelerate options)
- **Abstraction** - Move up abstraction levels to find new solution spaces
- **Inversion** - Flip constraints into features and reverse assumptions
- **Stakeholder** - Introduce new perspectives and collaborative opportunities
- **Resource** - Reallocate or discover untapped resources
- **Capability** - Leverage hidden skills or develop new competencies
- **Recombination** - Mix existing elements in novel ways **Advanced Option Generation Techniques**
  (NEW):

### Disney Method + Path Dependency Tracking

When using Disney Method, the system tracks how decisions in each role affect flexibility:

- **Dreamer decisions** may open new paths but require validation
- **Realist constraints** reduce options but increase feasibility
- **Critic insights** may require cycling back to earlier roles

### Nine Windows + Ergodicity Analysis

Nine Windows automatically integrates with ergodicity detection:

- **Past analysis** reveals if the domain has historical ruin events
- **System levels** show where non-ergodic risks emerge
- **Future projections** consider both ensemble and time averages

### Multi-Technique Workflows

Combine techniques for comprehensive analysis:

```json
{
  "techniques": ["nine_windows", "disney_method"],
  "reasoning": "Use Nine Windows to understand system context, then Disney Method to design solutions"
}
```

## Development Guidelines

### Dist File Management

This project includes compiled `dist/` files in the repository to support GitHub distribution via
`npx`. When making changes:

1. **Always rebuild after modifying src files**: Run `npm run build` before committing
2. **Commit dist changes with src changes**: Keep src and dist in sync
3. **Pre-push hook**: A git hook will prevent pushing with uncommitted dist changes
4. **Version script**: The `npm version` command automatically rebuilds and stages dist files

The pre-push hook will:

- ❌ Block pushes with uncommitted dist changes
- ⚠️ Warn if src was modified more recently than dist
- ✅ Pass when everything is in sync

## Best Practices

### Getting Started

1. Use `discover_techniques` to find the best approach for your problem
2. Create comprehensive workflows with `plan_thinking_session`
3. Follow the structured guidance through `execute_thinking_step`
4. Combine multiple techniques for complex challenges

### Technique-Specific Tips

- **Six Hats** - Begin with the Blue Hat to establish process and objectives
- **PO** - The more provocative the statement, the better the creative breakthrough
- **Random Entry** - Use genuinely random stimuli for unexpected connections
- **SCAMPER** - Complete all seven transformations for comprehensive exploration
- **Design Thinking** - Engage real users throughout the process
- **TRIZ** - Focus on identifying and resolving core contradictions
