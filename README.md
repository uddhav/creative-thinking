# Creative Thinking MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides structured creative thinking techniques for problem-solving and ideation. This server implements a unified framework combining generative creativity with systematic risk assessment.

## Architecture Principles

This project follows a three-layer tool architecture as its core design principle:

1. **Discovery** - Intelligent technique selection based on problem analysis
2. **Planning** - Structured workflow creation combining multiple techniques  
3. **Execution** - Guided step-by-step implementation with state management

### Fundamental Design Decision: Three Tools Only

**This MCP server exposes EXACTLY three tools - no more, no less:**
- `discover_techniques` - Analyzes problems and recommends techniques
- `plan_thinking_session` - Creates structured workflows
- `execute_thinking_step` - Executes individual steps

**All functionality must be integrated into these three tools.** This includes:
- Escape velocity analysis (integrated into discovery/planning)
- Option generation (automatic in discovery when flexibility is low)
- Session management (internal state management)
- Future features (must fit within the three-tool workflow)

This constraint ensures a clean, focused API that mirrors the natural creative thinking workflow and prevents tool proliferation.

## Overview

The three-layer architecture guides you through comprehensive problem-solving:

1. **Discovery Layer** (`discover_techniques`) - Analyzes problems and recommends suitable thinking techniques based on characteristics, context, and desired outcomes.

2. **Planning Layer** (`plan_thinking_session`) - Creates structured workflows that combine techniques, providing step-by-step guidance adapted to your timeframe.

3. **Execution Layer** (`execute_thinking_step`) - Guides you through each thinking step while maintaining session state and integrating risk assessment.

This layered approach ensures efficient problem-solving by matching techniques to problems, creating comprehensive workflows, and maintaining focus throughout the creative process.

## Core Features

### Twelve Enhanced Thinking Techniques

Each technique integrates creative generation with systematic verification:

- **Six Thinking Hats Plus** - Multi-perspective analysis with meta-uncertainty awareness
- **Provocative Operation (PO)** - Pattern-breaking through systematic verification
- **Random Entry** - Creative connections validated through systematic doubt
- **SCAMPER** - Systematic transformations with integrated pre-mortem analysis
- **Concept Extraction** - Cross-domain pattern transfer with boundary awareness
- **Yes, And** - Collaborative ideation with built-in critical evaluation
- **Design Thinking** - Human-centered innovation with embedded risk management
- **TRIZ** - Contradiction resolution through addition and systematic removal
- **Neural State** - Cognitive mode optimization for creative breakthroughs
- **Temporal Work Design** - Time-based problem solving and pressure transformation
- **Cross-Cultural Integration** - Multi-perspective synthesis across cultural frameworks
- **Collective Intelligence** - Wisdom aggregation from diverse knowledge sources

### Unified Framework Features

- Dual thinking modes with visual indicators for creative and critical phases
- Comprehensive risk and failure mode tracking across all techniques
- Antifragile solution design that benefits from stress and change
- Consideration of low-probability, high-impact events
- Meta-learning metrics to track session effectiveness

### Session Management

- Full session persistence with save, load, list, delete, and export capabilities
- Automatic progress saving and session tagging for organization
- Multiple export formats (JSON, Markdown, CSV) for different use cases
- Support for revisions and branching during creative exploration
- Progress tracking with visual indicators and formatted output
- Insights extraction and summary generation upon completion

### Ergodicity Awareness (NEW)

The server now tracks path dependencies and non-ergodic effects in creative thinking:

- **Path Memory System** - Tracks how each decision creates irreversible constraints
- **Flexibility Metrics** - Real-time monitoring of remaining creative options
- **Absorbing Barrier Detection** - Warns about approaching irreversible states like:
  - Cognitive lock-in (stuck in one way of thinking)
  - Analysis paralysis (overthinking preventing action)
  - Perfectionism trap (standards preventing completion)
- **Escape Routes** - Suggests ways to regain flexibility when options are limited
- **Visual Indicators** - Shows path metrics in every thinking step output

The system recognizes that creative processes are non-ergodic: each decision permanently changes the landscape of future possibilities. This helps you maintain awareness of path dependencies and avoid getting trapped in absorbing states.

### üö® Absorbing Barrier Early Warning System

The integrated early warning system continuously monitors for approaching "points of no return" in your creative process:

- **Multi-Sensor Monitoring**: Tracks cognitive rigidity, resource depletion, and technical debt accumulation
- **Four Warning Levels**: üü¢ SAFE > üü° CAUTION > üü† WARNING > üî¥ CRITICAL
- **Escape Protocols**: Provides actionable strategies to regain flexibility before hitting barriers
- **Visual Alerts**: Critical warnings appear prominently in the output to ensure timely action

When barriers are detected, the system recommends specific escape protocols ranging from simple pattern interruption to strategic pivots, each calibrated to your current flexibility level.

### üå± Option Generation Engine

When flexibility drops below 0.4, the system automatically activates the Option Generation Engine to create new possibilities through eight strategic approaches:

- **Decomposition** - Break monolithic commitments into flexible modules
- **Temporal** - Adjust time parameters (delay commitments, accelerate options)
- **Abstraction** - Move up abstraction levels to find new solution spaces
- **Inversion** - Flip constraints into features and reverse assumptions
- **Stakeholder** - Introduce new perspectives and collaborative opportunities
- **Resource** - Reallocate or discover untapped resources
- **Capability** - Leverage hidden skills or develop new competencies
- **Recombination** - Mix existing elements in novel ways

The engine evaluates each generated option for flexibility gain, implementation cost, reversibility, and synergy with existing choices, ensuring practical and effective recommendations.
