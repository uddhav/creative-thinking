## Features

### Creative Thinking Techniques (Enhanced with Unified Framework)

All techniques integrate creative generation with critical evaluation for robust, antifragile solutions:

- **Six Thinking Hats Plus**: Enhanced with Black Swan awareness - each hat considers unknown unknowns and extreme events
- **PO (Provocative Operation)**: With systematic verification - provocations are tested through hypothesis validation
- **Random Entry**: With systematic doubt - connections validated through Cartesian questioning
- **SCAMPER**: With pre-mortem analysis - each transformation includes "What could go wrong?" assessment
- **Concept Extraction**: With failure mode analysis - identifies where patterns won't work
- **Yes, And...**: With critical evaluation - includes "But" step for risk assessment
- **Design Thinking**: With embedded risk management - 5 stages integrating threat modeling and failure harvesting
- **TRIZ**: Enhanced with Via Negativa - systematic innovation through both addition and removal

### Key Features of the Unified Framework

- **Dual Thinking Modes**: Visual indicators (‚ú® creative, ‚ö†Ô∏è critical) show whether you're in generative or adversarial mode
- **Risk & Failure Mode Tracking**: All techniques support identifying risks, failure modes, and mitigations
- **Antifragile Properties**: Solutions designed to benefit from stress and volatility
- **Black Swan Consideration**: Techniques account for low-probability, high-impact events
- **Meta-Learning Metrics**: Track creativity scores, risks caught, and antifragile features across sessions

### Session Management Features

- **Session Persistence**: Save, load, list, delete, and export thinking sessions
- **Auto-save**: Automatically persist progress after each step
- **Tagging & Organization**: Categorize sessions with names and tags
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Export sessions as JSON, Markdown, or CSV
- Visual progress tracking with emojis and formatted output
- Support for revisions and branching in creative exploration
- Session management with unique IDs and history tracking
- Insights extraction and summary when sessions complete
- Colored console output with chalk (can be disabled with DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING environment variable)

## Techniques

### Six Thinking Hats Plus (Enhanced with Black Swan Awareness)
Edward de Bono's method enhanced with meta-uncertainty and extreme event consideration:
1. **Blue Hat Plus** üîµ: Process control with meta-uncertainty awareness - "What if our process assumptions are wrong?"
2. **White Hat Plus** ‚ö™: Facts and information including unknown unknowns - "What data might be hiding black swans?"
3. **Red Hat Plus** üî¥: Emotions, intuition, and collective behavior prediction - "What collective madness might emerge?"
4. **Yellow Hat Plus** üü°: Optimism, benefits, and positive black swans - "What explosive upsides might we miss?"
5. **Black Hat Plus** ‚ö´: Critical judgment and catastrophic discontinuities - "What could destroy everything?"
6. **Green Hat Plus** üü¢: Creativity and antifragile innovations - "What solutions get stronger under stress?"

### PO (Provocative Operation with Systematic Verification)
Four-step process for escaping mental patterns with hypothesis testing:
1. Create a provocative statement (Po: ...)
2. Suspend judgment and explore the provocation (then challenge it)
3. Extract and verify principles through hypothesis testing
4. Develop robust solutions addressing failure modes

### Random Entry (With Systematic Doubt)
Three-step creative connection process with validation:
1. Introduce a random stimulus (word, image, concept)
2. Generate connections with systematic doubt ("Is this always true?")
3. Validate insights before developing solutions

### SCAMPER (With Pre-Mortem Analysis)
Seven systematic transformations, each with risk assessment:
- **S**ubstitute: Replace parts with alternatives | "What dependencies break?"
- **C**ombine: Merge with other ideas or functions | "What conflicts arise?"
- **A**dapt: Adjust for different contexts | "What new vulnerabilities emerge?"
- **M**odify: Magnify, minimize, or modify attributes | "What breaks under enhancement?"
- **P**ut to other use: Find new applications | "What context-specific dangers?"
- **E**liminate: Remove unnecessary elements | "What's actually load-bearing?"
- **R**everse: Invert or rearrange components | "Which assumptions must hold?"

### Concept Extraction (With Failure Mode Analysis)
Four-step process for transferring successful principles across domains:
1. **Identify Success**: Analyze a successful solution from any domain
2. **Extract & Analyze Limitations**: Identify key principles AND where they wouldn't work
3. **Abstract with Boundaries**: Generalize patterns with clear domain boundaries
4. **Apply with Risk Assessment**: Transfer patterns only where success probability is high

### Yes, And... (With Critical Evaluation)
Four-step collaborative ideation process from improv theater:
1. **Accept (Yes)**: Acknowledge and accept the initial idea or contribution
2. **Build (And)**: Add creative expansions and possibilities
3. **Evaluate (But)**: Critically assess potential issues and risks
4. **Integrate**: Synthesize insights into a robust solution

### Design Thinking (With Embedded Risk Management)
Five-stage human-centered design process with integrated threat modeling:
1. **Empathize + Threat Modeling**: Understand user needs AND potential misuse cases
2. **Define + Problem Inversion**: Frame the problem AND ask "How might we fail?"
3. **Ideate + Devil's Advocate**: Generate solutions with internal critic for each idea
4. **Prototype + Stress Testing**: Build quick tests including edge cases and failure modes
5. **Test + Failure Harvesting**: Gather user feedback AND analyze what breaks

### TRIZ (Enhanced with Via Negativa)
Four-step systematic innovation through contradiction resolution:
1. **Identify Contradiction**: Find the core conflict (Need X but get Y)
2. **Via Negativa - What to Remove?**: Ask what can be eliminated before adding
3. **Apply Inventive Principles**: Use TRIZ principles both additively and subtractively
4. **Minimal Solution**: Achieve more by doing less - optimize through removal

## Session Management

The Creative Thinking tool now supports full session persistence, allowing you to save your creative thinking progress and return to it later.

### Session Operations

Add `sessionOperation` to your request to perform session management:

- **save**: Save the current session with optional name and tags
- **load**: Load a previously saved session
- **list**: List all saved sessions with filtering options
- **delete**: Delete a saved session
- **export**: Export a session in JSON, Markdown, or CSV format

### Quick Examples

Save current session:
```json
{
  "sessionOperation": "save",
  "saveOptions": {
    "sessionName": "Product Innovation Brainstorm",
    "tags": ["product", "innovation", "q1-2024"]
  }
}
```

List sessions:
```json
{
  "sessionOperation": "list",
  "listOptions": {
    "technique": "scamper",
    "status": "active"
  }
}
```

Load a session:
```json
{
  "sessionOperation": "load",
  "loadOptions": {
    "sessionId": "session_12345"
  }
}
```

Export a session:
```json
{
  "sessionOperation": "export",
  "exportOptions": {
    "sessionId": "session_12345",
    "format": "markdown"  // Options: "markdown", "json", "csv"
  }
}
```

### Export Formats

The tool supports three export formats:

- **Markdown**: Human-readable reports with rich formatting
- **JSON**: Complete structured data for analysis and integration
- **CSV**: Tabular data for spreadsheets and data visualization

See [examples/export-formats.md](examples/export-formats.md) for detailed export examples and use cases.

### Auto-Save

Enable automatic saving after each step by adding `"autoSave": true` to your thinking step requests.

### Configuration

- `PERSISTENCE_TYPE`: Storage backend (`filesystem` or `memory`)
- `PERSISTENCE_PATH`: Custom storage path (default: `~/.creative-thinking/sessions`)

For detailed session management examples, see [examples/session-management.md](examples/session-management.md).

## Building

Docker:

```bash
docker build -t creative-thinking .
```

NPM:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Usage Tips

1. **Start with Blue Hat**: For Six Hats technique, always begin with the Blue Hat to establish process and goals
2. **Embrace Absurdity**: For PO technique, the more provocative the statement, the better the creative leaps
3. **True Randomness**: For Random Entry, use genuinely random words - avoid choosing "relevant" stimuli
4. **Complete SCAMPER**: Work through all seven actions even if some seem less applicable
5. **Session Continuity**: The server maintains session state, allowing for natural creative flow
6. **Revision Support**: Use the revision feature to refine earlier creative outputs as insights develop
