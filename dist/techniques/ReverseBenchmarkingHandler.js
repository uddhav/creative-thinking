            1: `🗺️ **Step 1: Weakness Mapping**

Analyzing competitive landscape for: "${problem}"

Identify what ALL top competitors consistently do poorly or ignore completely.

Map these universal weaknesses:
${markers.map(m => `• ${m}`).join('\n')}

Key Actions:
1. List top 3-5 competitors in your space
2. Document what they ALL do poorly
3. Analyze why these weaknesses persist industry-wide
4. Look for "good enough" areas where excellence would stand out
5. Identify customer pain points everyone tolerates

Dare to Be Trivial (Rule 10):
What absurdly small, trivially easy improvement would have disproportionate
impact? The best competitive advantages often hide in the mundane — things
so simple that everyone assumes they can't matter. Fix the annoying thing
that everyone tolerates. The easiest improvements are often the best.

Examples to consider:
- Coffee/beer at fine dining (11 Madison Park)
- Direct sales in insurance (Direct Line)
- Real beauty in cosmetics (Dove)
- Customer service in airlines (Southwest)

Output: Comprehensive weakness map with persistence explanations`,
            2: `🔍 **Step 2: Vacant Space Analysis**

Evaluating opportunities for: "${problem}"

Assess the value of excelling in areas competitors ignore.

Analyze these opportunity dimensions:
${markers.map(m => `• ${m}`).join('\n')}

Vacant Space Evaluation Matrix:
| Weakness Type | Why Persists | Opportunity Value | Implementation Difficulty |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Industry blind spots | Groupthink | Very High | Low |
| "Good enough" areas | Low priority | High | Medium |
| Assumed impossibilities | Technical myths | Very High | Variable |
| Cultural taboos | Social norms | High | High |
| Economic assumptions | Pricing models | Very High | Low |

⚠️ Medium Reflexivity: Identifying these spaces begins to shape your strategic positioning.

Output: Prioritized list of vacant spaces with opportunity assessments`,
            3: `🎯 **Step 3: Anti-Mimetic Strategy**

Designing differentiation strategy for: "${problem}"

Create strategies that deliberately avoid copying competitor patterns.

Design these anti-mimetic elements:
${markers.map(m => `• ${m}`).join('\n')}

Anti-Mimetic Principles:
1. **Avoid triggering competitive responses** - Don't signal too early
2. **Build capabilities others can't copy** - Unique organizational DNA
3. **Create customer habits** - Lock in behavioral patterns
4. **Design evolutionary paths** - Routes competitors can't follow
5. **Preserve path independence** - Resist convergence pressure

Strategic Questions:
- What would we do if we couldn't see competitors?
- How can we make this impossible to copy?
- What sacred cows can we violate?
- Where can we be unreasonably good?

⚠️ Medium Reflexivity: Strategic choices here create organizational identity.

Output: Anti-mimetic strategy with differentiation vectors and resource allocation`,
            4: `⭐ **Step 4: Excellence Design**

Creating excellence standards for: "${problem}"

Design world-class execution in mundane, overlooked areas.

Define excellence across:
${markers.map(m => `• ${m}`).join('\n')}

Excellence Design Framework:
1. **Current Standard**: What's the industry baseline?
2. **Excellence Vision**: What would 10x better look like?
3. **Customer Impact**: How will this transform experience?
4. **Implementation Path**: Steps to achieve excellence
5. **Success Metrics**: How to measure differentiation

Real-World Excellence Examples:
- 11 Madison Park: Coffee sommelier at #1 restaurant
- Dove: Real beauty when others chase perfection
- Amazon: Same-day when overnight was "impossible"
- Apple: Beautiful packaging for disposable boxes

Remember: Excellence in the mundane > adequacy in the exotic

Costly Signaling (Rule 5):
Excellence in an overlooked area IS costly signaling. When you invest visibly
in something competitors dismiss as unimportant, you send a powerful message:
"If we care this much about X, imagine what everything else is like."
The very unexpectedness of the investment amplifies the signal.

⚠️ High Reflexivity: Excellence commitments shape brand perception permanently.

Output: Detailed excellence plan with implementation roadmap`,
            5: `🚀 **Step 5: Implementation Path**

Executing competitive advantage for: "${problem}"

Launch your differentiation while maintaining strategic advantage.

Execute across these dimensions:
${markers.map(m => `• ${m}`).join('\n')}

Implementation Strategy:
1. **Start Quietly**: Build capability without fanfare
2. **Perfect in Stealth**: Achieve excellence before revealing
3. **Reveal Strategically**: Time announcement for maximum impact
4. **Educate Market**: Help customers appreciate the difference
5. **Maintain Discipline**: Resist pressure to converge

Path Independence Preservation:
- Don't benchmark against converging competitors
- Ignore industry "best practices" in your vacant space
- Build organizational antibodies to mimetic pressure
- Celebrate what makes you weird
- Measure success differently

Competitive Response Management:
- They'll dismiss it as unimportant (good!)
- They'll say customers don't care (better!)
- They'll try to copy but fail (best!)
- They'll eventually converge (find new spaces!)

⚠️ High Reflexivity: Market entry creates irreversible competitive dynamics.
